# MongoDB Connector for OutSystems

## Overview

This MongoDB Connector is designed to facilitate seamless integration between OutSystems applications and MongoDB, a widely used NoSQL database. The connector allows developers to interact with MongoDB databases directly from OutSystems applications, enabling them to perform various operations like reading, writing, and updating data.

### Objective

The primary objective of this connector is to serve as an asset in the OutSystems Forge, making it available to the OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC) community. Developers can leverage this connector to easily integrate their OutSystems applications with MongoDB without the need for extensive coding or deep knowledge of MongoDB's internal workings.

## Features

- **Direct Interaction with MongoDB:** Perform CRUD operations directly on MongoDB from OutSystems applications.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Configure MongoDB connection settings dynamically from the OutSystems front-end.
- **Secure Connection:** [Future Feature] Ensure secure connections to MongoDB by encrypting sensitive information.
- **Easy Integration:** Designed to be easily integrated into OutSystems applications with minimal setup.
  
## How It Works

The MongoDB Connector utilizes C# code to interact with MongoDB and expose the necessary actions and data structures to OutSystems applications. The connector allows developers to configure MongoDB connection settings and perform operations like inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data.

## Usage

### Configuration View

- **Connection String:** The MongoDB connection string used to establish a connection with the database.
- **Database Name:** The name of the MongoDB database to interact with.
- **Collection Name:** The name of the MongoDB collection to perform operations on.

### Operations

- **Insert:** Insert data into the specified MongoDB collection.
- **Update:** Update data in the specified MongoDB collection based on a query.
- **Delete:** Delete data from the specified MongoDB collection based on a query.
- **Retrieve:** Retrieve data from the specified MongoDB collection based on a query.

## Integration with OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC)

The MongoDB Connector is intended to be utilized as an asset in the OutSystems Forge, providing a reusable component that can be leveraged by the ODC community. Developers can utilize this connector to integrate their OutSystems applications with MongoDB, thereby enhancing their applications with the capabilities of a NoSQL database.

### Benefits for ODC Community

- **Ease of Use:** Developers can easily integrate MongoDB into their applications without needing to write extensive code.
- **Reusable Component:** The connector can be reused across multiple projects, saving development time and effort.
- **Community Support:** Developers can share improvements and updates, enhancing the connector for the entire community.

## Future Enhancements

- **Encryption:** Implement encryption for sensitive data like connection strings to enhance security.
- **Additional MongoDB Operations:** Expand the connector to support additional MongoDB operations and functionalities.
- **Improved Error Handling:** Enhance error handling and provide detailed error messages for troubleshooting.

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Connector:** Obtain the MongoDB Connector from the OutSystems Forge.
2. **Integrate into Your Application:** Utilize the connector in your OutSystems application, configuring the MongoDB settings as per your requirements.
3. **Perform Operations:** Use the provided actions to interact with MongoDB and manipulate data as needed.
